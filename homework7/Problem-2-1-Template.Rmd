# --- Your code goes below ---
# (a)
...

# (b)
# Note that in (b) either use a new variable to store the model, or null out
# the variable that stored the model in (a) if you want to reuse that variable.
# The reason is that if you don't null it out, the model in (b) will have
# residual information left over from (a) and your results will not be quite
# accurate.

# (c) 

# (d)
