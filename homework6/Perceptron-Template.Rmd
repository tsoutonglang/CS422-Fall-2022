# The Perceptron function
#
# PARAMETERS:
# points: The dataset that is to be separated
# lamda:  The learning rate
# gamma:  The error threshold
#
# RETURNS
# A list containing three named elements.  The elements
# should be named: 
# "weights" - Contains the final weight vector (learned weights)
# "epochs"  - Number of epochs it took to converge
# "error"   - A vector of error calculated at the end of each epoch

# The sign function, this is the prediction function
# PARAMETERS:
# x : The X vector (input that needs to be predicted)
# weights: The weight vector
# RETURNS:
# -1 or 1
